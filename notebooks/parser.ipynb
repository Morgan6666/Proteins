to severe organ damage and death We characterized the timedependent progression of the disease in COVID inpa tients by measuring accredited diagnostic parameters such as blood cell counts and enzyme activities as well as untargeted plasma proteomes at sampling points We report an initial spike in a systemic inﬂam matory response which is gradually alleviated and followed by a protein signature indicative of tissue repair metabolic reconstitution and immunomodulation We identify prognostic marker signatures for devising riskadapted treatment strategies and use machine learning to classify therapeutic needs We show that the machine learning models based on the proteome are transferable to an independent cohort Our study presents a map linking routinely used clinical diagnostic parameters to plasma proteomes and their dy namics in an infectious disease INTRODUCTION from asymptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syn drome coronavirus SARSCoV to death despite maximum The coronavirus disease COVID has created unprece intensive care Biomarkers and molecular signatures enabling dented societal challenges particularly for public health and the accurate prognosis of future disease courses are needed to opti global economy Alwan et al Blumenthal et al mize resource allocation and personalize treatment strategies Rosenbaum Efﬁcient management of these challenges Patients likely to progress to severe disease and organ failure is hampered by the variability of clinical manifestations ranging and those likely to remain stable could be identiﬁed early

Batch correction was performed at the pre cursor level as described previously Messner et al using linear regression for intrabatch correction for each MS batch and control samples for interplate correction Protein quantiﬁcation was subsequently carried out using the MaxLFQ algorithm Cox et al Pham et al as implemented in the DIANN R package httpsgithubcomvdemichevdiannrpackage One of the well plates featured technical replicates of a number of samples that were also analysed on other plates in an extra batch correction step the median logprotein levels across these replicates on plate were matched to the respective median loglevels across the same biological samples throughout other plates to correct protein levels on plate Further batch correction was per formed for Innsbruck data to match the mean logtransformed protein levels in the respective control samples to logtransformed protein levels in control samples acquired for the Charite´ cohort The Generation Scotland cohort proteomics raw data which we described previously Messner et al have been reanalyzed using the updated software pipeline to ensure comparability Exclusion of precursors or proteins based on the data completeness was not performed Statistical testing was performed in the R environment for statistical computing version R core team wwwRprojectorg All protein and clinical laboratory measurements except for standard and actual base excess oxyhemoglobin and sO were ﬁrst log transformed to ensure optimal performance of linear models assuming Gaussian errors as well as to reduce the impact of outliers Imputation of the data was not performed as all the statistical tests applied can accommodate missing values Likewise no data ﬁltering based on missing value rates was applied For differential abundance testing only protein groups matched to at least three different unmodiﬁed peptide sequences were considered Signiﬁcance testing for a zero median for analysing trajectories or against binary variables worsening death was performed using the Wilcoxon W test or MannWhitney U test respectively as implemented in the ‘‘wilcoxtest’’ function of the ‘‘stats’’ R package Testing against a continuous variable eg when determining signiﬁcance of pairwise correlations was performed using the Kendall Tau test with the slope estimated using the TheilSen method as imple mented in the ‘‘kendallTrendTest’’ function of the ‘‘EnvStats’’ Millard package When covariates had to be taken into account we used linear modelling with the ‘‘limma’’ Ritchie et al R package with Pvalues obtained using ‘‘eBayes’’ Smyth Modelling with ‘‘limma’’ was likewise used to correct for these covariates for visualisation purposes WHO grade was considered as a ‘‘factortype’’ covariate resulting in a ‘‘limma’’ design matrix with onehot encoding for different WHO grades Multipletesting correction was performed using the BenjaminiHochberg false discovery rate controlling procedure Benjamini and Hochberg e Cell Systems –e–e July Please cite this article in press as Demichev et al A timeresolved proteomic and prognostic map of COVID Cell Systems httpsdoiorg jcels Article ll OPEN ACCESS as implemented in the ‘‘padjust’’ function of the ‘‘stats’’ R package The adjusted pvalues below were considered signiﬁcant Multipletesting correction for differential abundance analysis was performed separately for proteins for which MRMAssayDB lists a targeted assay Bhowmick et al the rest of proteins measured the clinical laboratory measurements and the clinical factors age Charlson score BMI Horowitz index and FiO SOFA score to ensure that the false discovery rate stayed below for each of these categories of features Likewise when determining the signiﬁcance of correlations in correlation matrices correction was performed for each row or each column separately to ensure less than false discoveries in each row or column respectively For correlation map visualisations black points were used to indicate rowwise signiﬁcant correlations and black rectangles at the border of the respective cell columnwise signiﬁcant correlations Quantities of gene products corresponding to open reading frames named IGxx ie different types of immunoglobulin chains were summed together to generate quantities representative of the overall levels of immunoglobulin classes IGHVs IGLVs etc This does not affect any conclusions of this work and was done purely to improve visualization and simplify the interpretation of the heatmaps and correlation maps Full protein level tables including levels of individual immunoglobulin gene products are provided in supple mentary materials For visualisation different WHO grades were colorcoded throughout the manuscript see Figure S Markers of the disease severity The ﬁrst time point measured at the maximum WHO grade was chosen for each patient For each omics feature its values logtrans formed when necessary as described above were tested for a trend depending on the WHO grade Age was included as a covariate in the linear model as described above Markers varying with age in COVID The ﬁrst sampling time point measured was chosen per patient For each omics feature its values logtransformed when necessary as described above were tested for a trend depending on age The test was performed either using the Kendall Tau test as described above Figures S and S or by accounting for WHO grade as a covariate in the linear model as described above Figures S and Markers of RRT and ECMO For each omics feature the Pvalue was calculated using the MannWhitney test comparing between the median levels logtrans formed when necessary as described above across all sampling time points at WHO grade in patients who did not receive the therapy and the median levels logtransformed when necessary as described above across all sampling time points at WHO grade after initiation of the respective therapy in patients who did Markers predictive of time in hospital Patients for which the ﬁrst sampling time point before the outcome corresponded to the WHO severity grade that is the patient did not require supplemental oxygen on that day were considered Thus no correction for disease severity was necessary Testing of levels logtransformed when necessary as described above of each omics feature measured for the ﬁrst sampling time point vs the remaining time in hospital days was performed by including age as a covariate in the linear model as described above Markers predictive of disease worsening The ﬁrst sampling time point measured was chosen per patient Future disease worsening was deﬁned as a future increase in the WHO grade for patients at WHO grade or death for patients at WHO grade For each omics feature its levels logtrans formed when necessary as described above were compared between patients who did not worsen and patients who did with age and current WHO grade as factor included as covariates in the linear model as described above Peak period of the disease deﬁnition When studying the dynamic changes in omics values during the disease course we focused on the time points sampled when the disease was the most severe for a particular patient This allowed us to look at molecular changes over time without the need to take into account the potential impact of changes in disease severity and the level of treatment For each patient we thus deﬁned the ‘‘peak period of the disease’’ as the time when the patient was receiving the most intensive treatment during their stay in hospital that is the time when the patient was at WHO grade or for patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation at some point or otherwise at their maximum WHO grade or Markers changing during the peak of disease Only patients with at least two days between the ﬁrst and last sampling time points at the peak of the disease as deﬁned above were considered For each omics feature a linear regression model was ﬁtted for its levels logtransformed when necessary as described above vs the day number with the slope estimated using the nonparametric TheilSen method as implemented in the ‘‘kendallTrendTest’’ function of the ‘‘EnvStats’’ Millard R package and the quantity slopeadj regression slope number of days between ﬁrst and last time points was calculated A nonparametric approach was chosen because of its superior robust ness to outliers A Wilcoxon W test was then applied to compare the median of slopeadj to zero The values of slopeadj for each feature are visualised in Figure S The nonparametric approach was chosen here due to its robustness with respect to outliers Cell Systems –e–e July e Please cite this article in press as Demichev et al A timeresolved proteomic and prognostic map of COVID Cell Systems httpsdoiorg jcels ll Article OPEN ACCESS Correlation maps General correlation maps were generated using the values logtransformed when necessary as described above of features at the ﬁrst time point measured at the maximum WHO grade for each patient The correlation map between feature changes during the peak of the disease as deﬁned above was generated by correlating the slopeadj values as deﬁned above The map of signiﬁcant protein correlations not detected in the general population was generated by excluding all correlations which were either signiﬁcant P without multipletesting correction with the same trend in the Generation Scotland cohort or could not be calculated reliably therein less than valid points Prediction of current mechanical ventilation To reﬂect the power of omics measurements in characterising the phenotype a classiﬁer was constructed to predict mechanical ventilation WHO grade at the present time point using the proteomic andor accredited diagnostic data For the proteomic data only proteins characterized by at least peptides were taken into account The ﬁrst time point measured at the maximum WHO grade was selected per patient We used a gradient boosted tree algorithm implemented in the XGBoost Chen and Guestrin under Python The classiﬁer was constructed using leaveoneout crossvalidation To circumvent overﬁtting a subsampling of of the training data per boosting step and an L regularization term ‘‘lambda’’ of were applied For the assessment of classiﬁer performance the leaveoneout method was applied in the following way the prediction was made for each sample separately by excluding withholding this sample from the dataset training the classiﬁer on the remaining indepen dent samples and then predicting the withheld sample using the trained model The source code is provided in supplementary ma terials For the determination of the feature importances one classiﬁer was trained on all data points using the same setup as described above The feature importances were then extracted directly from the trained classiﬁer For the validation of the trained models samples from an independent cohort Innsbruck were used A model was trained on the data collected at the Charite´ using the same setup and parameters as described above and the proteins that were characterized in both cohorts The evaluation was performed on the Innsbruck cohort that was not used for training ROCcurves and AUC were calculated using scikitlearn Pedregosa et al The machine learning scripts are provided in Data S WHO grade prediction For the prediction of the WHO grade an elastic net was applied as implemented in scikitlearn The WHO grade was predicted for the ﬁrst time point at maximum WHO grade per patient using a leaveoneout crossvalidation procedure A trainingprediction based on proteomic proteins with at least peptides andor accredited diagnostic data from the Charite´ cohort was performed Additionally the proteomic model was validated using proteomic data set from the Innsbruck cohort that was not included in the training Features with more than missing values were removed All data were logtransformed when necessary as described above standardized and kNNimputed neighbors The latter two steps were ﬁtted on the training data only For the elastic net an ‘‘lratio’’ of was used coupled to a fold crossvalidated recursive featureelimination algorithm ‘‘step’’ ‘‘minfeatures’’ Calculations of metrics were performed using scikitlearn and scipy Virtanen et al The machine learning scripts are provided in Data S Prediction of the remaining time in hospital For the prediction of the remaining time in hospital a WHO grade predictor as described above was trained on the ﬁrst data points for every patient The predicted WHO grades for every patient at WHO grade who stayed in hospital for at least day after sample time were correlated to the remaining time in hospital The Spearman correlation was calculated using scipy The machine learning scripts are provided in Data S Supplementary Note Diagnostic parameters and Proteome signatures that indicate therapeutic interventions We investigated to what extent speciﬁc organ replacement therapies in severely ill patients renal replacement therapy RRT and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO were reﬂected in the proteome and at the level of accredited diagnostic parameters HP and HPX were reduced in patients on RRT and ECMO reﬂecting hemolysis in the extracorporeal circuits Figures S and S Elevated SERPINC Antithrombin III levels mirror substitution of antithrombin during ECMO The reason for elevated levels of APOE in patients with ECMO is unclear but is in line with reports on increased levels of APOE in pediatric patients after cardiopul monary bypass Agirbas¸ li et al The proteins increased in patients receiving RRT mainly reﬂect impaired kidney function and have been associated with RRT before AMBP BM CST LYZ RBP Figure S Shao et al Of note increased levels of AMBP BM and LYZ have been associated with death in chronic kidney disease Makridakis et al Levels of CFD and APOH both involved in the complement system were also increased McDonnell et al Volanakis and Narayana CFD is elim inated renally and accumulates in end stage renal disease possibly leading to enhanced complement activation via the alternative pathway Pascual et al In contrast levels of APOH have even been reported to be slightly lower following highﬂux hemodi alysis Han et al We note that the analysis of the effect of treatments on the proteome has two limitations First some of the markers identiﬁed might be prognostic for the treatment rather than reﬂect its effect Age and the Charlson comorbidity index belong to this category patients receiving ECMO were signiﬁcantly younger and had a lower number of preexisting chronic conditions than those who did not e Cell Systems –e–e July Please cite this article in press as Demichev et al A timeresolved proteomic and prognostic map of COVID Cell Systems httpsdoiorg jcels Article ll OPEN ACCESS Second the results might be partially confounded by the time elapsed from the onset of the disease as we have shown Figure that omics signature changes with time in COVID patients while on invasive mechanical ventilation Supplementary Note Agespeciﬁc response to COVID in the context of severity markers Older age is one of the most signiﬁcant risk factors for severe disease and adverse outcome in COVID Enhanced understanding of underlying mechanisms for the agespeciﬁc response to SARSCoV infection is therefore important and needed for the devel opment of effective agespeciﬁc strategies for prevention and treatment Furthermore dissecting the agespeciﬁc components of the host response will improve our knowledge of the pathogenicity of similar viruses making the world better prepared for future pandemics Current theories characterizing the link between the higher age and risk for severe disease include immunosenescence elevated baseline inﬂammation or altered protein glycosylation landscape leading to impaired antiviral response or reduced immune tolerance Franceschi et al Goronzy and Weyand Rea et al Tay et al However a detailed and mecha nistic understanding of the relation between COVID and aging is lacking In this work we leverage the large size and high precision of the proteomic data acquired to map the agerelated response to COVID to provide a reference dataset Figures C and S for future studies addressing this problem We report elevation of several inﬂammatory and acute phase proteins such as SERPINA ITIH SAA and ITIH in older patients with COVID SAA has been shown to induce macrophage polarization to the Mtype which promotes tissue repair but also pos sesses proﬁbrotic properties involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary ﬁbrosis Liu et al Page et al Wermuth and Jimenez Moreover SAA mediates displacement of APOA from HDL leading to loss of the cardio and vasoprotective prop erties of high density lipoprotein HDL Gordon SERPINA as discussed above has an ambivalent role as a neutrophil pro teinase inhibitor but also a powerful neutrophil chemoattractant Upregulation of SERPINA with age in COVID along with the higher neutrophiltolymphocyte ratio suggests that excessive neutrophil response is one of the aggravating factors in older COVID patients Taken together our ﬁndings point toward a disproportionately dysregulated inﬂammatory response to SARS CoV with age which may be explained by an increased baseline inﬂammation and immunosenescence in older patients Chung et al Ferrucci et al Soysal et al Agedependent increase of FBLN and decrease of KLKB reﬂect alterations in blood coagulation which may aggravate this effect by predisposing older patients to thromboembolic events one of the key clinical characteristics of severe COVID Interestingly a number of apolipoproteins displayed a strong agespeciﬁc signature in COVID For instance APOC a compo nent of chylomicrons very low density lipoprotein VLDL and high density lipoprotein HDL and activator of lipoprotein lipase involved in triglyceride metabolism Ramasamy was downregulated with age in COVID but upregulated with age in the general population Harris et al Peters et al Figure C Dysregulation of apolipoproteins has been observed in com munity acquired pneumonia and associated with unfavourable outcome Sharma et al Remarkably contrary to the general trend APOD APOC and APOE show opposite trends in older COVID patients and in severe disease Figure APOD is ex pressed by many tissues including the brain Dassati et al An increase in APOD has been previously observed in ischemic stroke and CNS inﬂammation and may reﬂect subclinical involvement of the central nervous system especially in older patients with more severe inﬂammation and more comorbidities Muffat and Walker Conversely high levels of APOD have been shown to temper coronavirusmediated encephalitis in mice indicating its role as a marker of CNS damage as well as tissue protection and repair Carmo et al APOE involved in inﬂammation immune response and lipid metabolism is upregulated in severe COVID but downregulated with age in this cohort APOE typically mediates antiinﬂammatory effects by downregulation of NFkB and inhibition of macrophage response to IFNy and TLR both mediators of viral immune response Moreover it neutralizes bacterial LPS and enhances the adaptive immune response by facilitating antigen presentation Figueroa et al Downregula tion with age may reﬂect a compromised immune response leading to overactivation of NFkB and insufﬁcient pathogen clearance in older patients Finally APOE has been described to reduce proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells Murphy et al and to reduce myeloid derived suppressor cell MDSC survival in mice Tavazoie et al Thus lower levels of APOE in the elderly may favor expansion of immature and dysfunctional neutrophils that have been described as a hallmark in severe COVID SchulteSchrepping et al This broad involvement of APOE merits further investigation in future studies Supplementary Note Diverging trends at the proteome level during the disease peak in individual patients Some patients who died exhibited protein concentration trajectories distinctly similar to ‘‘typical’’ survivors Fig ure B Two of them had a prolonged ICU stay with repeated septic episodes and ﬁnally deﬁned limitations of therapy ac cording to presumed patients’ wishes ‘‘secondary DNR’’ Their protein signatures probably reﬂect the phenomenon of immune pa ralysis that can follow bacterial sepsis associated with a prolonged ICU treatment Patricio et al One patient was receiving ongoing immunosuppressive therapy for an autoimmune disorder and a fourth patient had a history of kidney transplantation both died of septic shock Whether the particular group of solid organ recipients shows a distinct protein signature associated with the outcome requires further investigation Cell Systems –e–e July e Please cite this article in press as Demichev et al A timeresolved proteomic and prognostic map of COVID Cell Systems httpsdoiorg jcels ll Article OPEN ACCESS We also note that some surviving patients do not show a trajectory characteristic of the typical ‘alleviation’ of the proteomic pheno type WHO WHO or Speciﬁcally the proteomic response in patients and was indicative of overall ‘worsening’ of the proteome Figure B In contrast patients and exhibited the overall ‘alleviation’ of the proteome except for the spike in the levels of CRP and serum amyloid Figure B Shorter time spans between sampling days may explain these observations in four of these patients indicating that the host inﬂammatory response requires a certain time to resolve especially in more severely ill patients and some of the markers of systemic inﬂammation might linger whereas a typical alleviation of the proteomic signature can be observed even within a few days in moderate disease courses The unusual pattern of patient was likely confounded by a skin infection that subsequently required antibiotic treatment e Cell Systems –e–e July'"
