We characterized the time-dependent progression of the disease in 139 COVID-19 inpa-tients by measuring 86 accredited diagnostic parameters, such as blood cell counts and enzyme activities, aswell as untargeted plasma proteomes at 687 sampling points. We report an initial spike in a systemic inﬂam-matory response, which is gradually alleviated and followed by a protein signature indicative of tissue repair,metabolic reconstitution, and immunomodulation. We identify prognostic marker signatures for devisingrisk-adapted treatment strategies and use machine learning to classify therapeutic needs. We show thatthe machine learning models based on the proteome are transferable to an independent cohort. Our studypresents a map linking routinely used clinical diagnostic parameters to plasma proteomes and their dy-namics in an infectious disease.INTRODUCTION                                                        from asymptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syn-                                                                    drome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to death, despite maximumThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created unprece-        intensive care.

The panel to the right of the heatmap provides manual functional annotation for theproteins. Known associations with COVID-19 severity are indicated (blue - downregulated in severe COVID-19, and red - upregulated) (D’Alessandro et al., 2020;Laing et al., 2020; Messner et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020). Below the heatmap, the time span between the ﬁrst and the last sampling time point at the peak of thedisease is indicated as well as the remaining time until the discharge (see also Figures S14 and S15, and Table S3).(C) Trajectories (change of log2-transformed levels with time) for selected proteins. Sampling points during the peak period of the disease (STAR methods) areconsidered. x axis: 0 – ﬁrst time point measured at the peak of the disease, 1 – last. The y axis reﬂects the change relative to the ﬁrst valid measurement during the peakof the disease. Loess approximations are shown for patients, which did (blue), and did not (orange), require invasive mechanical ventilation.

Proteins predictive of future worsening, i.e., disease progression to higher WHO gradeHIGH LEVELS INDICATIVE OF POOR PROGNOSISAGT: Angiotensinogen: Conversion via angiotensin-converting enzymes ACE and ACE2 produces AngI/AngII (pro-inﬂammatory,vasoconstrictive, pro-ﬁbrotic) and Ang1-7/Ang1-9 (anti-inﬂammatory, vasodilative, anti-ﬁbrotic), respectively (Turner, 2015; Zhanget al., 2020). Increased AGT likely reﬂects increased AngI/AngII due to SARS-CoV-2 mediated inactivation of ACE2 (Tay et al.,2020) and subsequently predominant conversion of AGT to AngII. AngII correlates with viral load (Liu et al., 2020c) and has tissuedamaging effects (Zhang et al., 2020).B2M: Beta-2-microglobulin: Component of major histocompatibility complex (MHC I) on all nucleated cells and platelets.Released abundantly by activated platelets leading to pro-inﬂammatory M1-like macrophage polarization (Hilt et al., 2019). In-crease of B2M has been associated with death in patients with chronic kidney disease (Makridakis et al., 2020).C1R: Complement C1r: Initiator of the classical complement pathway (Hajishengallis et al., 2017).CFD: Complement Factor D: Initiator of the alternative complement pathway by cleaving Factor B (CFB) to form the C3bBb alter-native pathway convertase (Volanakis and Narayana, 1996).CRP: C-reactive protein: Acute phase protein, strongly upregulated in inﬂammation and infection, including COVID-19.CST3: Cystatin C: Biomarker of kidney function (Peralta et al., 2011).SERPINA3: Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin: Protease inhibitor of neutrophil cathepsin G (Benarafa, 2015).

Overview of resources generatedWe provide deep and time-resolved resources that characterize COVID-19 at the level of plasma proteomes and established diag-nostic parameters. We demonstrate the extent to which proteomes and diagnostic parameters interdepend, in initial response to thedisease and in dynamics during the disease course. We show how they change with age, differ depending on the disease severity,reﬂect the therapy received and evolve over time. Our data have been acquired for COVID-19 patients’ samples and analyzed in thecontext of general population proteomics (Generation Scotland) for which samples have been measured with the same proteomictechnology (Messner et al., 2020), but we also expect it to be of high value as a reference for studies of other types of viral pneumoniaas well as any investigations involving both routine clinical phenotyping and plasma proteomics.Summary of the resource data generated in the study. 1. Covariation maps. We provide a covariation map between plasma proteins measured with at least 3 peptides and clinical lab-     oratory measurements (Figure 1B; Table S4). In addition, we provide a full covariation map between all features measured in     the study (Figure S3; Table S5) as well as a COVID-19 speciﬁc protein-protein covariation map (Figure S4; Table S6). Finally,     we also provide a correlation map for the changes of different omics features with time (Figure S12; Table S7). 2.

Summary: association of individual plasma proteins, routine diagnostic and physiological parameters with severity, necessarytherapy, and progression of COVID-19.For each statistical test considered (association with WHO grade, prediction of the remaining time in hospital for patients at WHO grade 3, prediction ofworsening, i.e., progression to a higher WHO grade in the future, the trend during the peak period of the disease, association with RRT, association with ECMOand association with higher patient age), measurements, which show signiﬁcant differences are highlighted, with the color indicating the trend, e.g., red for CST3in the ‘‘Association with COVID-19 severity’’ test indicates higher levels of CST3 in severely ill patients. Proteins for which MRMAssayDB (Bhowmick et al., 2018)lists that a targeted proteomic assay has been developed are indicated with a black bar at the top. Proteins which change signiﬁcantly with age in the Charite´COVID-19 cohort (FDR < 0.05) but do not change signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) with age in the general population (Generation Scotland cohort), are highlighted with awhite circle in the 7th row (‘‘Association with age’’).

The study protocol has been described in detail before (Kurth et al., 2020). Allpatients with PCR-conﬁrmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible for inclusion. Refusal to provide informed consent by the patientor a legal representative and any condition prohibiting supplemental blood collection for serial biosampling were exclusion criteria.Patients were treated according to current national and international guidelines. Three patients had Do Not Intubate and Do NotResuscitate (DNI/DNR) orders in place, declining mechanical ventilation and other organ support or cardiopulmonary resuscitation.In 4 further cases, limitation of therapy was decided at a later time point according to the patient’s presumed wish (‘‘secondary DNR’’)and predictably unfavorable outcome. All other patients received maximum intensive care treatment including organ replacementtherapies at the discretion of the responsible physicians.   Biosampling for proteome measurement was performed 3 times per week after inclusion. The WHO ordinal scale for clinicalimprovement (Table S1) was used to assess disease severity. ARDS was deﬁned according to the Berlin ARDS criteria (ARDS Deﬁ-nition Task Force et al., 2012). Sepsis was deﬁned according to sepsis-3 criteria (Singer et al., 2016). The study was approved by theethics committee of Charite´ - Universita€tsmedizin Berlin (EA2/066/20) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinkiand guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (ICH 1996). The study is registered in the German and the WHO international registry forclinical studies (DRKS00021688). Clinical data was captured in a purpose built electronic case report form data using the capturesystem SecuTrialÒ. All routine laboratory parameters were analyzed in accredited laboratories at Charite´ - Universita€tsmedizin Ber-lin. Pseudonymized data exported from SecuTrialÒ were processed using JMP Pro 14 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). If a lab-oratory value was missing for a given day, values from up to two preceding days were used for the analysis.Innsbruck Patient cohort and clinical dataSerum samples from 99 patients admitted to the intensive care unit at the Department of Medicine, University Hospital of Innsbruckfor the treatment of respiratory failure due to severe COVID-19 were collected within the ﬁrst days (median 7.5, IQR 5-12) after admis-sion. Written informed consent was either obtained before sampling or retrospectively after recovery, if patients were mechanicallyventilated at the time of sampling. COVID-19 was diagnosed on the basis of a (i) positive SARS-CoV2 PCR within the last 7 days priorto study inclusion, (ii) respiratory failure deﬁned as a partial pressure of oxygen < 60 mmHg on arterial blood gas analysis or a pe-ripheral oxygen saturation of < 90% and (iii) typical inﬁltrates on computed tomography scanning of the chest. Patients were treatedaccording to national guidelines. The study was approved by the local ethics research committee EK-Nr. 1107/2020, and EK-Nr.1103/2020 for follow-up.METHOD DETAILSMaterialsWater for chromatography (LC-MS Grade, LiChrosolvÒ, Merck; 115333), Acetonitrile (LC-MS Grade Optima; A955-212) and Meth-anol (LC-MS Grade, Optima; A456-212) were purchased from Fisher Chemicals.

Control samples were prepared from Human Serum (Sigma Aldrich, S7023-50MB) and Human Plasma (EDTA, Pooled Donor, Genetex GTX73265).Mass spectrometryMass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis was performed as described previously (Messner et al., 2020) with minor adjust-ments to the workﬂow (Figure S1). Semi-automated sample preparation was performed in 96-well format, using in advance preparedstock solution plates stored at -80C. Brieﬂy, 5ml of thawed plasma samples were transferred to the pre-made denaturation/reductionstock solution plates (55ml 8M Urea, 100mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC), 50mM dithiothreitol) resuspended and incubated at 30Cfor 60 minutes. 5ml was then transferred from the iodoacetamide stock solution plate (100mM) to the sample plate and incubated inthe dark at 23C for 30 minutes before dilution with 100mM ABC buffer (340ml). 220ml of this solution was transferred to the pre-madetrypsin stock solution plate (12.5ml, 0.1mg/ml) and incubated at 37C for 17 h (Benchmark Scientiﬁc Incu-Mixer MP4). The digestionwas quenched by addition of formic acid (10% v/v, 25ml). The digestion mixture was cleaned-up using C18 96-well plates (Bio-PureSPE Macro 96-Well, 100mg PROTO C18, The Nest Group) and redissolved in 60ml 0.1% formic acid with shaking. Insoluble par-ticles were removed by centrifugation and the samples transferred to a new plate.   Each 96-well plate contained 8 plasma and 4 serum sample preparation controls, and the acquisition workﬂow included a pooledquality control sample every ~10 injections. Liquid chromatography was performed using the Agilent 1290 Inﬁnity II system coupledto a TripleTOF 6600 mass spectrometer (SCIEX) equipped with IonDrive Turbo V Source (Sciex). A total of 5ml was injected, and thepeptides were separated in reversed phase mode using a C18 ZORBAX Rapid Resolution High Deﬁnition (RRHD) column 2.1mm x50mm, 1.8mm particles or Inﬁnitylab Poroshell 120 EC-C18, 2.1 x 50mm 1.9 mm particles. A linear gradient was applied which rampsfrom 1% B to 40% B in 5 minutes (Buffer A: 0.1% FA; Buffer B: ACN/0.1% FA) with a ﬂow rate of 800ml/min. For washing the column,the organic solvent was increased to 80% B in 0.5 minutes and was kept for 0.2 minutes at this composition before going back to 1%B in 0.1 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the high sensitivity mode. The DIA/SWATH method consisted of an MS1 scanfrom m/z 100 to m/z 1500 (20 ms accumulation time) and 25 MS2 scans (25ms accumulation time) with variable precursor isolationwidth covering the mass range from m/z 450 to m/z 850 (Messner et al., 2020). An IonDrive Turbo V Source (Sciex) was used with ionsource gas 1 (nebulizer gas), ion source gas 2 (heater gas) and curtain gas set to 50, 40 and 25, respectively. The source temperaturewas set to 450 and the ion spray voltage to 5500V. System suitability was evaluated using synthetic peptides (Sciex 5045759, Bio-gnosys Ki-30002-b) and human protein extracts (Promega V6951).QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSISData analysisThe data were processed with DIA-NN (Demichev et al., 2020), an open-source software suite for DIA / SWATH data processing(https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN, commit 4498bd7) using a two-step spectral library reﬁnement procedure as described pre-viously (Messner et al., 2020), with ﬁltering at precursor level q-value (1%), library q-value (0.5%) and gene group q-value (1%). Highlyhydrophobic peptides (reference retention time > 110 on the iRT scale) were discarded. Batch correction was performed at the pre-cursor level as described previously (Messner et al., 2020), using linear regression for intra-batch correction (for each MS batch) andcontrol samples for inter-plate correction. Protein quantiﬁcation was subsequently carried out using the MaxLFQ algorithm (Coxet al., 2014; Pham et al., 2020) as implemented in the DIA-NN R package (https://github.com/vdemichev/diann-rpackage). One ofthe 96-well plates (#12) featured technical replicates of a number of samples that were also analysed on other plates: in an extra batchcorrection step, the median log2-protein levels across these replicates on plate 12 were matched to the respective median log2-levels(across the same biological samples) throughout other plates, to correct protein levels on plate 12. Further batch correction was per-formed for Innsbruck data, to match the mean log2-transformed protein levels in the respective control samples to log2-transformedprotein levels in control samples acquired for the Charite´ cohort. The Generation Scotland cohort proteomics raw data, which wedescribed previously (Messner et al., 2020), have been reanalyzed using the updated software pipeline, to ensure comparability.Exclusion of precursors or proteins based on the data completeness was not performed.   Statistical testing was performed in the R environment for statistical computing, version 3.6.0 (R core team, www.R-project.org). Allprotein and clinical laboratory measurements (except for standard and actual base excess, oxyhemoglobin and sO2) were ﬁrst log2-transformed, to ensure optimal performance of linear models assuming Gaussian errors, as well as to reduce the impact of outliers.Imputation of the data was not performed, as all the statistical tests applied can accommodate missing values. Likewise, no dataﬁltering based on missing value rates was applied. For differential abundance testing, only protein groups matched to at least threedifferent unmodiﬁed peptide sequences were considered. Signiﬁcance testing for a zero median (for analysing trajectories) or againstbinary variables (worsening, death) was performed using the Wilcoxon W test or Mann-Whitney U test, respectively, as implementedin the ‘‘wilcox.test’’ function of the ‘‘stats’’ R package. Testing against a continuous variable (e.g. when determining signiﬁcance ofpairwise correlations) was performed using the Kendall Tau test, with the slope estimated using the Theil-Sen method, as imple-mented in the ‘‘kendallTrendTest’’ function of the ‘‘EnvStats’’ (Millard, 2014) package. When covariates had to be taken into account,we used linear modelling with the ‘‘limma’’ (Ritchie et al., 2015) R package, with P-values obtained using ‘‘eBayes’’ (Smyth, 2004).Modelling with ‘‘limma’’ was likewise used to correct for these covariates for visualisation purposes. WHO grade was consideredas a ‘‘factor-type’’ covariate (resulting in a ‘‘limma’’ design matrix with one-hot encoding for different WHO grades). Multiple-testingcorrection was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate controlling procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)e3 Cell Systems 12, 1–15.e1–e7, July 21, 2021Please cite this article in press as: Demichev et al., A time-resolved proteomic and prognostic map of COVID-19, Cell Systems (2021), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2021.05.005Article     ll         OPEN ACCESSas implemented in the ‘‘p.adjust’’ function of the ‘‘stats’’ R package. The adjusted p-values below 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.Multiple-testing correction for differential abundance analysis was performed separately for proteins, for which MRMAssayDB lists atargeted assay (Bhowmick et al., 2018), the rest of proteins measured, the clinical laboratory measurements and the clinical factors(age, Charlson score, BMI, Horowitz index and FiO2, SOFA score), to ensure that the false discovery rate stayed below 0.05 for eachof these categories of features. Likewise, when determining the signiﬁcance of correlations in correlation matrices, correction wasperformed for each row or each column separately, to ensure less than 5% false discoveries in each row or column, respectively.For correlation map visualisations, black points were used to indicate row-wise signiﬁcant correlations, and black rectangles atthe border of the respective cell - column-wise signiﬁcant correlations.   Quantities of gene products corresponding to open reading frames named IGxx (i.e. different types of immunoglobulin chains) weresummed together to generate quantities representative of the overall levels of immunoglobulin classes (IGHVs, IGLVs, etc). This doesnot affect any conclusions of this work and was done purely to improve visualization and simplify the interpretation of the heatmapsand correlation maps. Full protein level tables, including levels of individual immunoglobulin gene products, are provided in supple-mentary materials. For visualisation, different WHO grades were color-coded throughout the manuscript (see Figure S2).Markers of the disease severityThe ﬁrst time point measured at the maximum WHO grade was chosen for each patient. For each omics feature, its values (log2-trans-formed when necessary, as described above) were tested for a trend depending on the WHO grade. Age was included as a covariatein the linear model as described above.Markers varying with age in COVID-19The ﬁrst sampling time point measured was chosen per patient. For each omics feature, its values (log2-transformed when necessary,as described above) were tested for a trend depending on age. The test was performed either using the Kendall Tau test (as describedabove; Figures S9 and S10), or by accounting for WHO grade as a covariate in the linear model (as described above; Figures S11and 5).Markers of RRT and ECMOFor each omics feature, the P-value was calculated using the Mann-Whitney test, comparing between the median levels (log2-trans-formed when necessary, as described above) across all sampling time points at WHO grade 7 in patients who did not receive thetherapy and the median levels (log2-transformed when necessary, as described above) across all sampling time points at WHO grade7 after initiation of the respective therapy in patients who did.Markers predictive of time in hospitalPatients, for which the ﬁrst sampling time point before the outcome corresponded to the WHO = 3 severity grade (that is the patientdid not require supplemental oxygen on that day), were considered. Thus, no correction for disease severity was necessary. Testingof levels (log2-transformed when necessary, as described above) of each omics feature (measured for the ﬁrst sampling time point) vsthe remaining time in hospital (days) was performed by including age as a covariate in the linear model as described above.Markers predictive of disease worseningThe ﬁrst sampling time point measured was chosen per patient. Future disease worsening was deﬁned as a future increase in theWHO grade (for patients at WHO grade < 7) or death (for patients at WHO grade 7). For each omics feature, its levels (log2-trans-formed when necessary, as described above) were compared between patients who did not worsen and patients who did, withage and current WHO grade (as factor) included as covariates in the linear model as described above.Peak period of the disease deﬁnitionWhen studying the dynamic changes in omics values during the disease course, we focused on the time points sampled when thedisease was the most severe for a particular patient. This allowed us to look at molecular changes over time without the need to takeinto account the potential impact of changes in disease severity and the level of treatment. For each patient, we thus deﬁned the‘‘peak period of the disease’’ as the time when the patient was receiving the most intensive treatment during their stay in hospital,that is the time when the patient was at WHO grade 6 or 7, for patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation at some point,or otherwise at their maximum WHO grade (3, 4 or 5).Markers changing during the peak of diseaseOnly patients with at least two days between the ﬁrst and last sampling time points at the peak of the disease (as deﬁned above) wereconsidered. For each omics feature, a linear regression model was ﬁtted for its levels (log2-transformed when necessary, asdescribed above) vs the day number (with the slope estimated using the nonparametric Theil-Sen method, as implemented in the‘‘kendallTrendTest’’ function of the ‘‘EnvStats’’ (Millard, 2014) R package), and the quantity slopeadj = (regression slope) * (numberof days between ﬁrst and last time points) was calculated. A non-parametric approach was chosen because of its superior robust-ness to outliers. A Wilcoxon W test was then applied to compare the median of slopeadj to zero. The values of slopeadj for each featureare visualised in Figure S14. The non-parametric approach was chosen here due to its robustness with respect to outliers.

The correlation map between feature changes during the peakof the disease (as deﬁned above) was generated by correlating the slopeadj values (as deﬁned above). The map of signiﬁcant proteincorrelations not detected in the general population was generated by excluding all correlations which were either signiﬁcant (P <=0.05, without multiple-testing correction) with the same trend in the Generation Scotland cohort, or could not be calculated reliablytherein (less than 20 valid points).Prediction of current mechanical ventilationTo reﬂect the power of omics measurements in characterising the phenotype, a classiﬁer was constructed to predict mechanicalventilation (WHO grade > 5) at the present time point using the proteomic and/or accredited diagnostic data. For the proteomicdata only proteins characterized by at least 3 peptides were taken into account. The ﬁrst time point measured at the maximumWHO grade was selected per patient. We used a gradient boosted tree algorithm implemented in the XGBoost 1.2.0 (Chen andGuestrin, 2016) under Python 3.8.1. The classiﬁer was constructed using leave-one-out cross-validation. To circumvent overﬁttinga subsampling of 0.5 of the training data per boosting step and an L2 regularization term ‘‘lambda’’ of 20 were applied.   For the assessment of classiﬁer performance, the leave-one-out method was applied in the following way: the prediction was madefor each sample separately, by excluding (withholding) this sample from the dataset, training the classiﬁer on the remaining (indepen-dent) samples and then predicting the withheld sample using the trained model. The source code is provided in supplementary ma-terials. For the determination of the feature importances, one classiﬁer was trained on all data points using the same setup asdescribed above. The feature importances were then extracted directly from the trained classiﬁer.   For the validation of the trained models, samples from an independent cohort (Innsbruck) were used. A model was trained on thedata collected at the Charite´ using the same setup and parameters as described above and the proteins that were characterized inboth cohorts. The evaluation was performed on the Innsbruck cohort that was not used for training. ROC-curves and AUC werecalculated using scikit-learn 0.23.2 (Pedregosa et al., 2011). The machine learning scripts are provided in Data S1.WHO grade predictionFor the prediction of the WHO grade an elastic net was applied as implemented in scikit-learn 0.23.2. The WHO grade was predictedfor the ﬁrst time point at maximum WHO grade per patient using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. A training/predictionbased on proteomic (proteins with at least 3 peptides) and/or accredited diagnostic data from the Charite´ cohort was performed.Additionally, the proteomic model was validated using proteomic data set from the Innsbruck cohort that was not included in thetraining. Features with more than 10% missing values were removed. All data were log2-transformed when necessary (as describedabove), standardized and kNN-imputed (5 neighbors). The latter two steps were ﬁtted on the training data only. For the elastic net an‘‘l1_ratio’’ of 0.05 was used coupled to a 5-fold cross-validated recursive feature-elimination algorithm (‘‘step’’ = 10, ‘‘min_features’’ =20). Calculations of metrics were performed using scikit-learn 0.23.2 and scipy 1.5.2 (Virtanen et al., 2020). The machine learningscripts are provided in Data S1.Prediction of the remaining time in hospitalFor the prediction of the remaining time in hospital a WHO grade predictor as described above was trained on the ﬁrst data points forevery patient. The predicted WHO grades for every patient at WHO grade 3 who stayed in hospital for at least 1 day after sample timewere correlated to the remaining time in hospital. The Spearman correlation was calculated using scipy 1.5.2. The machine learningscripts are provided in Data S1.Supplementary Note 1. Diagnostic parameters and Proteome signatures that indicate therapeutic interventionsWe investigated to what extent speciﬁc organ replacement therapies in severely ill patients, (renal replacement therapy (RRT) andextracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)) were reﬂected in the proteome and at the level of accredited diagnostic parameters.HP and HPX were reduced in patients on RRT and ECMO, reﬂecting hemolysis in the extracorporeal circuits (Figures S7 and S8).Elevated SERPINC1 (Antithrombin III) levels mirror substitution of antithrombin during ECMO. The reason for elevated levels ofAPOE in patients with ECMO is unclear, but is in line with reports on increased levels of APOE in pediatric patients after cardiopul-monary bypass (Ag^irbas¸ li et al., 2015). The proteins increased in patients receiving RRT mainly reﬂect impaired kidney function andhave been associated with RRT before (AMBP, B2M, CST3, LYZ, RBP4, Figure S7) (Shao et al., 2015). Of note, increased levels ofAMBP, B2M and LYZ have been associated with death in chronic kidney disease (Makridakis et al., 2020). Levels of CFD and APOH,both involved in the complement system, were also increased (McDonnell et al., 2020; Volanakis and Narayana, 1996). CFD is elim-inated renally and accumulates in end stage renal disease, possibly leading to enhanced complement activation via the alternativepathway (Pascual et al., 1988). In contrast, levels of APOH have even been reported to be slightly lower following high-ﬂux hemodi-alysis (Han et al., 2018).   We note that the analysis of the effect of treatments on the proteome has two limitations. First, some of the markers identiﬁed mightbe prognostic for the treatment rather than reﬂect its effect. Age and the Charlson comorbidity index belong to this category: patientsreceiving ECMO were signiﬁcantly younger and had a lower number of pre-existing chronic conditions than those who did not.e5 Cell Systems 12, 1–15.e1–e7, July 21, 2021Please cite this article in press as: Demichev et al., A time-resolved proteomic and prognostic map of COVID-19, Cell Systems (2021), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2021.05.005Article     ll         OPEN ACCESSSecond, the results might be partially confounded by the time elapsed from the onset of the disease, as we have shown (Figure 3) thatomics signature changes with time in COVID-19 patients while on invasive mechanical ventilation.Supplementary Note 2. Age-speciﬁc response to COVID-19 in the context of severity markersOlder age is one of the most signiﬁcant risk factors for severe disease and adverse outcome in COVID-19. Enhanced understandingof underlying mechanisms for the age-speciﬁc response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is therefore important and needed for the devel-opment of effective age-speciﬁc strategies for prevention and treatment. Furthermore, dissecting the age-speciﬁc components ofthe host response will improve our knowledge of the pathogenicity of similar viruses, making the world better prepared for futurepandemics. Current theories characterizing the link between the higher age and risk for severe disease include immunosenescence,elevated baseline inﬂammation, or altered protein glycosylation landscape leading to impaired antiviral response or reduced immunetolerance (Franceschi et al., 2018; Goronzy and Weyand, 2013; Rea et al., 2018; Tay et al., 2020). However, a detailed and mecha-nistic understanding of the relation between COVID-19 and aging is lacking. In this work, we leverage the large size and high precisionof the proteomic data acquired to map the age-related response to COVID-19, to provide a reference dataset (Figures 2C, 5, and S11)for future studies addressing this problem.   We report elevation of several inﬂammatory and acute phase proteins such as SERPINA3, ITIH4, SAA1, and ITIH3 in older patientswith COVID-19. SAA1 has been shown to induce macrophage polarization to the M2-type which promotes tissue repair but also pos-sesses pro-ﬁbrotic properties involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary ﬁbrosis (Liu et al., 2014; Page et al., 2012; Wermuth andJimenez, 2015). Moreover, SAA1 mediates displacement of APOA1 from HDL leading to loss of the cardio- and vasoprotective prop-erties of high density lipoprotein (HDL) (Gordon, 2014). SERPINA3, as discussed above, has an ambivalent role as a neutrophil pro-teinase inhibitor but also a powerful neutrophil chemoattractant. Upregulation of SERPINA3 with age in COVID-19, along with thehigher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, suggests that excessive neutrophil response is one of the aggravating factors in olderCOVID-19 patients. Taken together, our ﬁndings point toward a disproportionately dysregulated inﬂammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 with age, which may be explained by an increased baseline inﬂammation and immunosenescence in older patients (Chunget al., 2019; Ferrucci et al., 2005; Soysal et al., 2016). Age-dependent increase of FBLN1 and decrease of KLKB1 reﬂect alterationsin blood coagulation which may aggravate this effect by predisposing older patients to thromboembolic events, one of the key clinicalcharacteristics of severe COVID-19.   Interestingly, a number of apolipoproteins displayed a strong age-speciﬁc signature in COVID-19. For instance, APOC2, a compo-nent of chylomicrons, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL), and activator of lipoprotein lipaseinvolved in triglyceride metabolism (Ramasamy, 2014), was downregulated with age in COVID-19, but upregulated with age in thegeneral population (Harris et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2015) (Figure 2C). Dysregulation of apolipoproteins has been observed in com-munity acquired pneumonia and associated with unfavourable outcome (Sharma et al., 2017). Remarkably, contrary to the generaltrend, APOD, APOC3 and APOE show opposite trends in older COVID-19 patients and in severe disease (Figure 5). APOD is ex-pressed by many tissues, including the brain (Dassati et al., 2014). An increase in APOD has been previously observed in ischemicstroke and CNS inﬂammation and may reﬂect (subclinical) involvement of the central nervous system especially in older patients withmore severe inﬂammation and more comorbidities (Muffat and Walker, 2010). Conversely, high levels of APOD have been shown totemper coronavirus-mediated encephalitis in mice, indicating its role as a marker of CNS damage as well as tissue protection andrepair (Carmo et al., 2008). APOE, involved in inﬂammation, immune response and lipid metabolism, is upregulated in severeCOVID-19 but downregulated with age in this cohort. APOE typically mediates anti-inﬂammatory effects by downregulation ofNFkB and inhibition of macrophage response to IFNy and TLR3, both mediators of viral immune response. Moreover, it neutralizesbacterial LPS and enhances the adaptive immune response by facilitating antigen presentation (Figueroa et al., 2019). Downregula-tion with age may reﬂect a compromised immune response leading to over-activation of NFkB and insufﬁcient pathogen clearance inolder patients. Finally, APOE has been described to reduce proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells (Murphy et al., 2011) and toreduce myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC) survival in mice (Tavazoie et al., 2018). Thus, lower levels of APOE in the elderlymay favor expansion of immature and dysfunctional neutrophils that have been described as a hallmark in severe COVID-19(Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020). This broad involvement of APOE merits further investigation in future studies.Supplementary Note 3. Diverging trends at the proteome level during the disease peak in individual patientsSome patients (59, 90, 96, 123) who died exhibited protein concentration trajectories distinctly similar to ‘‘typical’’ survivors (Fig-ure 3B). Two of them (59, 90) had a prolonged ICU stay with repeated septic episodes and ﬁnally deﬁned limitations of therapy ac-cording to presumed patients’ wishes (‘‘secondary DNR’’). Their protein signatures probably reﬂect the phenomenon of immune pa-ralysis that can follow bacterial sepsis associated with a prolonged ICU treatment (Patricio et al., 2019). One patient (96) was receivingongoing immunosuppressive therapy for an autoimmune disorder, and a fourth patient (123) had a history of kidney transplantation,both died of septic shock. Whether the particular group of solid organ recipients shows a distinct protein signature associated withthe outcome requires further investigation.

Speciﬁcally, the proteomic response in patients 106, 153 and 141 was indicativeof overall ‘worsening’ of the proteome (Figure 3B). In contrast, patients 43 and 80 exhibited the overall ‘alleviation’ of the proteome,except for the spike in the levels of CRP and serum amyloid (Figure 3B). Shorter time spans between sampling days may explainthese observations in four of these patients (43, 58, 80, 106), indicating that the host inﬂammatory response requires a certaintime to resolve, especially in more severely ill patients, and some of the markers of systemic inﬂammation might linger, whereas atypical alleviation of the proteomic signature can be observed even within a few days in moderate disease courses. The unusualpattern of patient 153 was likely confounded by a skin infection that subsequently required antibiotic treatment.e7 Cell Systems 12, 1–15.e1–e7, July 21, 2021
